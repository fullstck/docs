| Environment      | Base URL |

| Production       | https://api.notif.immo    |
| Sandbox   | https://preprod-api.notif.immo       |

<Tip>
When using our `sandbox` environment, keep in mind that the data is static and may not represent real-time or complete datasets. 

To obtain meaningful results, consider making **broader queries**. This helps ensure you retrieve relevant data points, even within the limited sandbox dataset. 

When you transition to the `production` environment, you'll be able to execute more specific queries with dynamic and comprehensive data.
