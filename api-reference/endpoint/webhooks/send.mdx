api: "GET /webhook-tester"
description: "This endpoint will simulate a `match` or an `event` to the given endpoint."

<Warning>
Restricting your endpoints to our IP addresses is highly recommended for security reasons:
+ Sandbox: `178.238.226.136`
+ Production: `195.201.86.35` `136.243.17.46`

Your server implementation should return a `200` HTTP status code if the data was received successfully. If a webhook fails, it will be retried up to five times. Every retry will take place 1 hour after the previous one.
</Warning>

<Tip>
In order to use webhooks in production, you need to provide on [POST /searches](http://docs.melo.io/api-reference/endpoint/searches/create) an `endpointRecipient` to receive new matches in real time or/and an `eventEndpoint` to receive new advert events in real time.

You can choose the events you want to subscribe to using the `subscribedEvents` parameter. All types of events are listed below this section.

You also need to set the `notificationEnabled` parameter to `true` in order to receive webhooks.
